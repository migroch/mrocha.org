    CourseDescription: "This course is an introduction to the fundamental physical principles that control the world around us. Students will explore the fundamental principles of physics, their historical development, their application to everyday phenomena, and their impact upon political, social, and environmental issues. Laboratory exercises will explore the everyday world. ADVISORY: Mathematics 430. ",
