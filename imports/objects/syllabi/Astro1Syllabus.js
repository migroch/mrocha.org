    CourseDescription: "This course is an introduction to General Astronomy, with enphasis in theory rather than observations. Students will learn about science, scientific measurements, the solar system, planets,  stars, galaxies and the origins, evolution and structure of the Universe as a whole (i.e. Cosmology). We will also cover the basics of telescopes and astronomical observations. ADVISORY: Mathematics 430. ",
    CourseMotive: {mrocha:"Astronomy and Physics are all about trying to understand the mysteries of the universe, and after each discovery realize how much more there is to know.", hawking:"To confine our attention to terrestrial matters would be to limit the human spirit."},    
    LearningObjectives: [
	"Identify, describe, compare and contrast the various units of numbers and their significance.",
	"Describe what science is and be familiar with the Scientific Method.",
	"Understand how astronomers collect their data and reach their conclusions.",
	"Understanding the Physics of Gravity and Light",
	"Describe the basic composition and construction of the solar system and its origin.",
	"Demonstrate an understanding of planets, starts, stellar phenomena, galaxies and galaxy formation.",
	"Describe the origin, evolution and structure of the Universe.",
